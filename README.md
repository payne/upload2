# Try it on GitHUB: https://payne.github.io/upload2/upload-table

## Notes

After Angular-University.io helped me with basics of angular material table, I wanted to get editing of the table working.
So, I studied this random google result: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-custom-pagination-mat-table?file=src%2Fmain.ts and got 
a version of it working here.  Joy! 

In the upload table component there's a simple array of objects (`uploadsData`) that gets turned into a table where
1. The whole table is a build by looping over VOForm  
2. The VOForm holds a `formBuilder.group` that is one  
    1. `formBuilder.array` and each row of the array is 
        1. `formBuilder.group` and that group is a row -- with each column in the row being a `FormControl`   


It's slick!  There's one form with many groups.  One of the groups is an array.  In that array there is one group for each row in the table.

### Trying github co-pilot

https://youtu.be/vSxVhg5RX6E is an unlisted (1 minute & 47 second) video showing off how co-pilot is helpful.  It fills in repetiative things nicely.

## TODO 

1. Implement an edit (pencil) icon button and save button for each row like the example above
1. Figure out how to change the column widths
2. Connect it to a backend
